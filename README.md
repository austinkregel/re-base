# Re:base Tauri
This project is written in Rust, and the frontend stack is Vue/Vite/Tailwind.

Heavily inspired by the UI of the now defunct [Koding](https://koding.com).

Goal: lightweight coding environments, deployable to any host.

Features:

- [x] Basic file saving
- [x] Set Projects, set directories
